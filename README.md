# 🎉 Dance Pattern Animation in C 🎉

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is a console-based dance animation written in C, showcasing a lively dance pattern using ASCII characters. The dancers move in sync, creating an engaging animation in the terminal. The code primarily uses `for` and `if` statements for the dance logic and `<conio.h>` to add color.

## ✨ Features
- **Dynamic Animation**: ASCII dancers perform a series of moves in a loop.
- **Colorful Display**: Each dancer is displayed in a different color (requires `<conio.h>`).
- **Customizable Speed**: Adjust the animation speed for different effects.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Visual Studio Code or any C-supported IDE
- `<conio.h>` library for color (available in many compilers)
